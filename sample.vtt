00:31:58.717 --> 00:31:59.785
WITH APPROPRIATE CPR,

00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:03.488
THE PATIENT TO HAVE A CHANCE.

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:04.690
20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:09.728
AND WHAT'S YOUR TRANSPORT TIME?

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:13.098
40 MINUTES.

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:17.202
SO IS IT JUST ONE PENETRATING
WOUND TO THE ABDOMEN?

00:32:17.202 --> 00:32:17.703
OKAY.

00:32:17.703 --> 00:32:20.171
YEAH, THEN GO AHEAD
AND TRANSPORT HER.

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:21.106
GIVEN THAT
IT'S A YOUNG PERSON,

00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:25.043
IT'S WORTH TO AT LEAST GIVE HER
A FIGHTING CHANCE.

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:27.412
IN A 21-YEAR-OLD
WITH A STORY LIKE THAT,

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:29.013
WE'VE JUST GOT TO DO IT.

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.482
BYE.

00:32:30.482 --> 00:32:31.717
WE'RE
THE LEVEL 1 TRAUMA CENTRE

00:32:31.717 --> 00:32:32.484
FOR THE LOWER MAINLAND,

00:32:32.484 --> 00:32:34.853
SO IF THIS PATIENT HAS A CHANCE
OF SURVIVAL,

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:38.423
TO COME HERE
WILL BE OUR BEST CHANCE.

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:40.692
-WE'RE GETTING
A SECOND STABBING COMING IN.

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:43.796
SO WE'RE POTENTIALLY GETTING
TWO PEOPLE.

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:44.329
-YEAH.

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:46.765
-THE DISPATCHER, HE SAID
THEY SHOULD BE CALLING US

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:47.633
TO LET US KNOW,

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:48.567
BUT AS FAR AS HE KNOWS,

00:32:48.567 --> 00:32:50.302
RIGHT NOW
THERE'S TWO COMING HERE.

00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:50.769
-OKAY.

00:32:50.769 --> 00:32:52.437
-HE DOESN'T KNOW THE EXTENT
OF THE INJURIES.

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.104
-OKAY.

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:54.972
SO TWO MORE ON TOP OF THE GIRL,
OR INCLUDING THE GIRL.

00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:55.941
-NO, TWO, TWO, TWO.

00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:57.075
-IN TOTAL,
GIRL AND ANOTHER ONE.

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:59.678
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
THERE'S ANOTHER VICTIM NOW.

00:32:59.678 --> 00:33:01.413
SO DO WE HAVE TWO TRAUMA BAYS?

00:33:01.413 --> 00:33:04.182
-YEAH, WE DO, ONE AND TWO.

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:05.884
-SO NOW WE'VE GOT
TWO STABBINGS COMING IN.

00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:07.118
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:20.866
-THANK YOU.

00:33:20.866 --> 00:33:22.300
-OPEN YOUR FIST NOW.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:22.868
-I'M STARTING

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:25.971
TO HAVE RENEWED EMPATHY
FOR PATIENTS NOW,

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:28.239
GETTING POKED.

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:30.575
-ALMOST DONE.

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:31.677
-HI, KATHERINE.
I'M DR. GILL.

00:33:31.677 --> 00:33:32.978
I'M ONE
OF THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS.

00:33:32.978 --> 00:33:33.912
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
-HI. GOOD.

00:33:33.912 --> 00:33:35.681
I DON'T THINK
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER YET.

00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:37.349
-I DON'T THINK SO.
-I JUST STARTED HERE.

00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:38.550
-OH, WELL, WELCOME.
-THANK YOU.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.785
-I'M SORRY
THAT WE'RE MEETING...

00:33:39.785 --> 00:33:40.752
-LIKE THIS.
-LIKE THIS.

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:42.454
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE THE PATIENTS.

00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:43.121
-I KNOW.

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:45.891
-AND I UNDERSTAND
YOU WERE DISCARDING AN IV...

00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:46.291
-YEAH.

00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:48.527
-AND A BIT OF BLOOD
SPLASHED BACK TO YOU?

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:48.961
-YEP.

00:33:48.961 --> 00:33:50.161
-AND IT GOT YOU
RIGHT IN THE EYE?

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.130
-I DIDN'T SEE IT,
BUT AS SOON AS I THREW IT,

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.398
I FELT THE FLUID.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.332
-OKAY.

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:56.001
WHAT I WOULD NORMALLY RECOMMEND
IS THAT WE IRRIGATE IT OUT.

00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.236
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
THE BEST THING THAT WE CAN DO.

00:33:58.236 --> 00:33:59.170
-YEAH.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.740
I HAVE TO SIT THERE
WITH A BAG OF SALINE,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.776
FLUSHING FLUID OUT OF MY EYE.

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:17.422
LET'S SEE
IF I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.858
-GETTING SPLASHED IN THE EYE
WITH A STRANGER'S BLOOD

00:34:19.858 --> 00:34:21.894
IS NEVER A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.

00:34:21.894 --> 00:34:23.395
YOU THINK
ABOUT THE PATIENT'S BLOOD.

00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:25.263
YOU THINK ABOUT,
"ARE THEY HIGH-RISK PATIENTS?

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:29.267
WHAT'S THE CHANCE
THEY HAVE HIV, HEPATITIS C?"

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:31.003
SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:34:31.003 --> 00:34:33.038
-DID YOU PUT THAT IN THERE
BY YOURSELF?

00:34:33.038 --> 00:34:33.505
-YEAH.

00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:35.640
-OH, MY GOODNESS.
DID YOU PUT TETRACAINE IN?

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.274
-UH, NO.

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:37.676
-IS IT DRIVING YOUR EYE NUTS?

00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:41.413
-IT'S NOT TOO BAD.
-OKAY.

00:34:41.413 --> 00:34:45.050
-THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR THE CDC,
THE CENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL,

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:49.087
IN CASE ANYTHING TURNS UP
POSITIVE,

00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:51.489
WHICH I HOPE IT WON'T.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.959
IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE
IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:54.726
FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE.

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:57.029
YOU HAVE TO GET FOLLOWED-UP
FOR NINE MONTHS

00:34:57.029 --> 00:34:58.030
DOING BLOOD TESTS.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.098
-YOU SAID YOUR TETANUS
WAS UP TO DATE.

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:00.532
-YEP.

00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:04.937
-HIV STATUS AND HEPATITIS B
WILL GET FOLLOWED IN BLOODWORK,

00:35:04.937 --> 00:35:09.708
AND HEP C,
WE HAVE NO TREATMENT FOR.

00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:10.776
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?
-NO.

00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:12.911
-OKAY, AND YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
TO FOLLOW UP?

00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:13.645
-I'VE GOT EVERYTHING.

00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:15.047
-IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
IT'S "EW, GROSS.

00:35:15.047 --> 00:35:16.548
WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN
TO ME?"

00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:17.382
-YEAH, I KNOW.

00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:18.884
OKAY, THANK YOU.
-THANKS.

00:35:18.884 --> 00:35:22.220
SEE YOU.
-BYE.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.021
-IF IT WAS HIGH-RISK,

00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:26.257
I'D HAVE TO GO
ON THE ANTI-RETROVIRALS

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:27.492
AND MEDICATIONS TO STOP,

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:29.962
WHICH, I'VE HEARD,
HAS PRETTY NASTY SIDE EFFECTS.

00:35:29.962 --> 00:35:32.998
SENDING MY BLOOD TO THE LAB

00:35:32.998 --> 00:35:36.434
TO GET TESTED
FOR HIV,

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:39.071
HEP C, AND HEP B.

00:35:39.071 --> 00:35:40.505
GOOD.

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.373
DONE.

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:46.177
I CAN GO BACK TO WORK NOW.

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:47.846
HAVING TO WAIT
FOR BLOOD TEST RESULTS

00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:49.815
DEFINITELY MAKES YOU LOSE
A COUPLE NIGHTS' SLEEP.

00:35:49.815 --> 00:35:53.785
I MEAN, IT'S UNFORTUNATELY
A HAZARD OF THE JOB.

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:54.552
I MEAN, THIS IS SOMETHING

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:58.090
THAT CAN'T REALLY BE PREDICTED
OR PREVENTED.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:08.433
IT HAPPENS.

00:36:08.433 --> 00:36:11.937
-THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
IS KIND OF A LIVE ENTITY.

00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:14.272
IT'S ALMOST
A BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM,

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.674
WITH MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PATIENTS

00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:20.012
THAT YOU'RE MANAGING
OR CARING FOR AT THE SAME TIME.

00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:22.914
SOMEBODY MIGHT BE RECEIVING
IV ANTIBIOTICS

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:23.648
FOR SEVERE PNEUMONIA.

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:28.020
SOMEBODY MIGHT BE INVESTIGATED
FOR A POTENTIAL HEART ATTACK,

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.622
AND SO THAT SORT
OF DYNAMIC WORLD

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:32.256
IS VERY UNIQUE
TO EMERGENCY MEDICINE,

00:36:32.256 --> 00:36:48.506
AND I THINK IT SETS IT APART
FROM OTHER FIELDS OF MEDICINE.

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:52.010
-TWO STABBING VICTIMS,
10, 20 MINUTES OUT.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.445
ONE IS IN TRAUMATIC ARREST,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:56.681
THERE ARE GOING TO BE
TWO VICTIMS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:59.117
-LET'S GET THIS JOB DONE.
-ALL RIGHT?

00:36:59.117 --> 00:37:00.218
-SO, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.953
IS WE'RE GOING
TO ACTIVATE THE TRAUMA TEAM.

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:04.622
-AND THAT'S WHEN I START DOING
ALL MY NOTIFICATIONS

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:06.424
TO GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:06.992
-A HEADS-UP

00:37:06.992 --> 00:37:08.727
THAT WE'VE GOT TWO TRAUMAS
COMING IN,

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:10.996
ONE OF THEM
DEFINITELY BY CHOPPER.

00:37:10.996 --> 00:37:12.931
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN THEY FINALLY ARRIVE,

00:37:12.931 --> 00:37:15.600
BUT IT'S PART OF THE TRAUMA TEAM
ACTIVATION.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.835
THANKS. BYE.

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:17.969
OKAY.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:18.870
-NOW WE'RE GOING TO CALL IN

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.138
OUR COLLEAGUES
FROM THE TRAUMA SERVICE

00:37:20.138 --> 00:37:23.575
AND THE RESIDENT TEAM
TO COME AND HELP US OUT.

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:26.444
-SOMETIMES IT'S THE CASES
THAT ARE THE MOST CRITICAL

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:27.179
THAT ARE ACTUALLY EASIER

00:37:27.179 --> 00:37:30.082
BECAUSE CERTAIN PROTOCOLS
JUST COME INTO PLAY.

00:37:30.082 --> 00:37:31.349
-TRAUMA TEAM ACTIVATION.

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:33.018
I'M JUST GIVING YOU
THE HEADS-UP.

00:37:33.018 --> 00:37:33.852
-WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS,

00:37:33.852 --> 00:37:36.955
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT OUR SAFETY IS MAINTAINED.

00:37:36.955 --> 00:37:40.324
-NICOLE?
ARE YOU PUTTING US ON LOCKDOWN?

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:42.060
-SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE
POLICE.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.030
WE HAVE SECURITY TO MAKE SURE
THAT IN A STAB WOUND SITUATION,

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.898
ONE OF THE VICTIMS
ISN'T A CRIMINAL,

00:37:46.898 --> 00:37:49.000
AND THAT THERE'S NOT
OTHER "RELATIVES"

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.170
THAT COULD COME AFTER EITHER
THE PATIENT OR THE CAREGIVER.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.774
-I HAVEN'T GOT THE DETAILS YET.

00:37:55.774 --> 00:37:58.376
AS SOON AS I FIND OUT,
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:01.379
NICOLE SPEAKING.

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.514
-AND THE OTHER CONSIDERATION
FOR US

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:03.982
IS THAT

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:05.951
WHILE
THERE'S A BIG, DRAMATIC EVENT

00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:06.684
GOING ON,

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:08.153
THERE'S OTHER SICK PATIENTS
IN THE DEPARTMENT,

00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:10.255
SO WHILE OUR ENERGIES
GET FOCUSED

00:38:10.255 --> 00:38:11.957
ON THE TWO SICKEST PATIENTS,

00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:14.159
WE DON'T WANT TO FORGET
THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENT,

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:15.160
WHICH COULD BE VERY ACTIVE,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.828
SO THAT'S
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW,

00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:20.999
TRY TO TIDY UP EVERYTHING.

00:38:20.999 --> 00:38:32.244
[♪♪♪♪♪]

00:38:32.244 --> 00:38:34.846
-WE DON'T KNOW
WHEN THEY'RE COMING, DO WE?

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:35.213
-HMM?

00:38:35.213 --> 00:38:36.447
-WE DON'T KNOW
WHEN THEY'RE COMING.

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:38.016
-NO, WE DON'T KNOW.

00:38:38.016 --> 00:38:39.251
-YEAH.

00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:43.888
-HE JUST STARTED DEVELOPING
NUMBNESS IN HIS RIGHT LEG

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:44.823
ON FRIDAY,

00:38:44.823 --> 00:38:48.093
AND IT INCREASINGLY GOT WORSE
THROUGH SATURDAY,

00:38:48.093 --> 00:38:52.063
AND THEN SUNDAY, HE HAD
NO STRENGTH IN IT WHATSOEVER.

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:54.199
-I'VE LOST ALL THE STRENGTH
IN MY LEGS,

00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:56.268
AND MY DOCTOR UP IN TERRACE
LAST NIGHT

00:38:56.268 --> 00:39:00.337
MENTIONED LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE
AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

AND A WHOLE BUNCH
OF NICE THINGS.

THAT HE WAS BEING FLOWN DOWN
FROM TERRACE.

THEY RAN A BUNCH OF TESTS,
AND IT HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED NOW.

00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:12.617
HE'S GOT GUILLAIN-BARRE
SYNDROME.

00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:15.954
-I HAD THE FLU LAST WEEK,

LIKE THAT.

THIS OTHER SYMPTOM COMES ON,

AND IT'S WHERE YOUR ANTIBODIES
THAT COME

TO FIGHT THE FLU I HAD

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:29.667
DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP
AFTER THE FLU'S GONE AWAY.

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:30.401

WE'VE STILL GOT OTHER THINGS
TO DO IN THIS BODY,"

00:39:31.636 --> 00:39:34.772

YOUR SPINAL CORD.

-IT CAN AFFECT
YOUR RESPIRATORY.

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:40.745
IT CAN CAUSE YOU
TO BECOME A QUADRIPLEGIC,

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:42.814
BUT THEY FEEL CONFIDENT

00:39:42.814 --> 00:39:45.750
THAT THEY CAUGHT IT EARLY ENOUGH
THAT HE'LL BE FINE.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.085
-THEY KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER.

00:39:47.085 --> 00:39:48.053
THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT ME
FOR IT.

00:39:48.053 --> 00:39:50.121
THEY FIGURE IT'LL TAKE
ABOUT FOUR DAYS OF TREATMENT,

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.890
AND THEN
THEY'LL BE MONITORING ME.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:55.160
IT'S KIND OF NICE JUST TO KNOW
THAT YES, THEY CAN CURE IT.

-AND SO NOW
I'M JUST BASICALLY TRYING

I WON'T GET UP TO THE ROOM
FOR A WHILE,

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:07.538

AROUND THE CORNER.

00:40:09.207 --> 00:40:12.010
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT
TO THE WAITING ROOM

THEY HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO BE HERE.

SOME OF THEM STILL HAVE
THE POSITIVE ATTITUDE

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.295
TO JUST WANT
TO WATCH THE HOCKEY GAME

00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:32.030
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON THEIR HEALTH,

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:36.334
WHICH IS GOOD.

-USUALLY,
SOMEBODY OF THAT AGE GROUP

THEY TOLD ME IT WAS.

WITH CHILDREN

IF THEY HAVE A TRAUMA TEAM

00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:34.512
THAT CAN HANDLE
PENETRATING TRAUMA,

00:43:34.512 --> 00:43:36.847
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT JUST WANT
TO DIVERT TO US.
