00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:05.506
Walking out of the airport and
taking that first deep breath

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:11.278
of that BC ocean,
Vancouver air is kind of like,

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.413
it's like "Wow," you know,
that's good.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.915
That's home.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.517
When you're a hockey player,
you're a bit of a gypsy,

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:20.721
and you live your life kind
of on the road, per se.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.191
I never had that feeling even
when I played in other cities

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:27.628
that that was home.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.230
I kind of was stationed there.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.270
Things were right
when I got back.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.306
Home for me is when I go
to the coffee shop,

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.543
people that I don't know
will maybe make a comment

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:43.443
about the game last night.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:46.079
That's what I expect and
that's kind of become

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.650
a sense of comfort.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.720
I don't look to avoid that
or get away from that

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.523
you know because it's just
become kind of normal

00:00:56.523 --> 00:01:01.896
and part of my life.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:07.001
I bought my first home
in Kits in 1990.

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.004
Boy, I agonized over
buying that place

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:11.872
and it was such a big thing.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:14.207
I lived there for 15 years.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:19.780
I'll never forget when I moved
out to come here,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.184
the movers came and
packed everything up,

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.353
put it on the truck
and they drove away.

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:32.091
It was 5:00 in the afternoon,
it was nice late August.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.695
Kind of looked through the house
and there was nothing left

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:38.665
and I sat on the front step
and I just, I started to cry.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:42.069
It was like, wow.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.406
I loved living there, I loved
living in Kits point.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:51.812
I get very connected
to where I live

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:54.481
and I think that's one of
the reasons why Vancouver's

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.217
meant so much to me, and
the sense of belonging I get

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.754
that is probably most
important to me

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:02.790
when you think about home.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.958
<i>Away goes Linden.</i>

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:04.524
<i>Trevor Lind</i>

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:13.199
scores!

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.869
<i>And Trevor Linden</i><i>isn't</i>
